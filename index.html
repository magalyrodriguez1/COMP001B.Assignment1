    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</p>
    <p>I hope to learn a lot in this course. I hope to really understand
        the syntax and what different design choices I can make using CSS. So far, I understand how to 
    select elements. Like standard elements are p{} (in this case using <p></p>) Selecting classes are done by
    using a period. so, .hello{} would select the class that is called hello. Selecting id is done by using a #, like #hi{}.</p>
<p>Although I do know some basic things to change, I hope to learn a lot more than just changing colors and editing text sizes.
    I know a little bit about creating boxes but not too much.</p>
    <p>I really hope to be able to be able to have a lot of fun with it too and really be able to design different projects.</p>
